See [the arbc_poss](/arbc_poss) folder for a tool that can be used to practice forming arabic possessives. Write a list of nouns in `nouns.txt` in the following format:  
<code>NOUN_IN_ARABIC,NOUN_IN_ENGLISH,WEIGHT</code>  
where the "weight" is a number that determines how often that noun will show up while practicing. You should not change the suffixes in `suffixes.txt`, but you can change the weights if you want to study some of them more than others. Once you have finished configuring them, run `python3 quiz.py` in your terminal!
